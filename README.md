# Employment Portfolio
Portfolio for prospective employers. Contains school projects which may have varying degrees of collaboration or professor provided skeleton code.
Hopefully they will give you an idea of my abilities as a programmer as well as my ability to create in a multitude of technologies. If you would 
like any further information about myself or my projects, please find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-rice/

### c_sharp_ai

Artificial intelligence board game created to demonstrate an adversarial computer opponent. Game utilized the Minimax algorithm to create and search a game tree for the next best computer move. Application was designed using rules presented by the Professor. Implemented as a Windows application using the C# programming language.

### oop_game

Mobile game designed to utilize Java's object oriented features. Application implemented the Codename One mobile framework. Work was graded on functionality and proper use of design patterns and OOP principles.

### os_scheduler

Operating system scheduler developed in C. Simulated a CPU scheduler using two different scheduling techniques: round-robin and lottery. Code uses several different C libraries including signal, setjmp, sys/time and sys/queue. Demonstrates proficiency in CPU scheduling, signals, threading and function pointers.

### senior_proj_app

Senior project web application using the Angular 4 framework. Tasked by UC Davis Medical Center with creating a charting application that allowed a user to upload and view datasets in several different formats. Utilized the Google Maps and Charts APIs as well as several open-source Angular plugins (i/e angular2-charts, FileUploader). All data is dynamically generated via numerous calls to our implemented controllers. Mapping functionality as well as some refactoring done by Jacob Lampl (another member of the team, jlampl@csus.edu).

### senior_proj_controller

Another piece of the senior design project was implementing a controller. This PHP API directs URL requests to the appropriate class and method with the correct parameters. The action then varies from uploading a document to returning a JSON response. Lavacharts and PHPExcel libraries facilitate some data handling. Focus was to keep the API clean and scalable. Small feature additions done by Jacob Lampl.
